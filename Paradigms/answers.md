Part 1: Concept Check (5 pts)

1.What is a programming paradigm?
A programming paradigm is a way of structuring code.

2.How is Object-Oriented Programming different from Procedural Programming?
For Object Oriented Programming, the object(entities) and data are embedded together while for procedural programming they are kept seperate.

3.Give one real-world analogy for Functional Programming.
I understand functional programming in the perspective of a mathematical function.
Eg; formula or recipe for baking a cake where the inputs are specified in measurements and combined in a predefined way to get a desired output(cake).
E.g; Preheat Oven to 250 degrees, mix 1/2 cup sugar and butter. Add 500ml milk. Add cake 2 cups cake flour.

4.Why might someone choose Declarative code over Procedural in UI development?
Declarative paradigm reduces error margins as they reduce the size of the code itself and the states of elements are specified. 

Part 3: Paradigm Mapping (5 pts)
1. Building a complex UI with reusable components	- Declarative programming
2. Writing a short script to automate image resizing	- Procedural programming
3. Creating a math utility library that’s easy to test and reuse - Functional programming
4. Modeling different types of bank accounts with shared and custom rules - Object Oriented programming(complex states)

Part 4: Apply & Reflect (10 pts)
You're building a simple To-Do List manager. The features:

Add tasks
Mark tasks as complete
Print number of pending tasks
4A. Choose one paradigm:
Procedural
Object-Oriented
Functional✅ 
Write a small code sketch implementing the task logic using your chosen paradigm. Add inline comments.

4B. Reflect on your choice (in answers.md):
Why did you choose this paradigm?
What are its tradeoffs or strengths?
Would your solution scale in a large team or codebase?
